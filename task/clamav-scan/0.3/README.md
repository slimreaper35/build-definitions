# clamav-scan task

## Description:
The clamav-scan task scans files for viruses and other malware using the ClamAV antivirus scanner.
ClamAV is an open-source antivirus engine that can be used to check for viruses, malware, and other malicious content.
The task will extract compiled code to compare it against the latest virus database to identify any potential threats.
The logs will provide both the version of ClamAV and the version of the database used in the comparison scan.

## Version 0.3:
On this version clamscan is replaced by clamdscan which can scan an image in parallel (8 threads by default).
Besides that, if the pipeline task uses a matrix configuration for the task, each arch will create a separate TaskRun, running in parallel.

## --max-filesize: 
Is set to the same value as the default value according to the ClamAV official Documentation.
